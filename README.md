Super excellent meteor strike mapping and navigate-to application.

Minimum Viability = Successful mapping of strikes on googlemap that has nav functionality. Filter for showing strikes based on found/landed.


_ What do we need from NASA API? _
- Need the coordinates of the strikes = GeoLocation
- how do we pull strike data?

_ What do we need from GMAPS API?
- The map itself, and routing.
- How do interact with the map?
- How do we interact with routing?
- How do we feed it coordinates?

_ How do we mesh the two? _
- Find a way to input NASA coords on to the GMAP


_ How do we display the results? _
- We need to show the map, start location, and destination
- do we use a special icon on the map display to mark strikes?/How do we?
